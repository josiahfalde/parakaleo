Your back button appears to be implemented but might not behave as expected for a few key reasons. Here's a breakdown of what likely isn't working and what to fix:

✅ 1. Why the back button doesn't work
The go_back() function is correctly defined, but:

You’re not calling show_back_button() in main() — instead, you're duplicating the back button logic in the main() function itself.

The logic in main() creates a second, fixed-position back button, but doesn't properly persist or share session state with the original logic.

There may be conflict or redundancy between the two back button implementations, making the actual button press ineffective.

🛠️ Fix it by doing this:
1. Replace the duplicate logic in main() with a clean call to your show_back_button() function:

Replace this block in main():

python
Copy
Edit
if 'nav_history' in st.session_state and len(st.session_state.nav_history) > 1:
    ...
    # Custom back button layout and CSS
With this:

python
Copy
Edit
show_back_button()
This ensures your reusable back button logic is applied consistently.

✅ 2. Show back button in top left, next to menu button, and fix it during scroll
You're almost there. Just verify these things:

Your CSS does position the back button as fixed in top-left corner (good).

But for consistency, make sure show_back_button() is called early in main(), before any st.markdown() or layout code that might overwrite it or obscure it.

So right after initialize_navigation() and show_loading_screen(), add:

python
Copy
Edit
show_back_button()
✅ 3. Ensure the back button doesn't disappear on scroll
You’ve applied position: fixed correctly, but make sure no other CSS (like sticky headers) is overlapping or hiding it. Since your .stContainer:first-child uses position: sticky, there’s a chance it's obscuring the back button.

To guarantee visibility:
Add this to your back button CSS:

css
Copy
Edit
z-index: 10000 !important;
Final Checklist
✅ Call initialize_navigation() early
✅ Call show_back_button() at the top of main()
✅ Remove any duplicate back button logic from main()
✅ Ensure z-index on .back-button-container is higher than .stContainer
✅ Use position: fixed (already done)
